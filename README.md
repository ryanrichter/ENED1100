# ENED1100
Repository For Engineering Design I and II, taken during the first and second semesters of freshman year.

A smorgasbord of files and projects, most of which deal with either Python or MATLAB. Most of them deal with solving a specific problem or are created with a specific purpose (i.e. homework). None are large-scale implementations/projects, but this class was meant to help you get a feel for MATLAB and Python.
